The program lets the user choose between three texts, stored in the variable TEXTS:

If the user selects a text number that is not in the input, the program will warn him and exit, if the user enters an input other than a number, the program will also warn him and exit. For the selected text, it will calculate the following statistics:

number of words,
number of words starting with a capital letter,
number of words written in capital letters,
number of words written in lowercase letters,
number of numbers (not digits),
sum of all numbers (not digits) in the text.
The program will display a simple bar graph that will represent the frequency of different word lengths in the text
